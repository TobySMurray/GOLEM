		'Another subject was observed in live trials resorting to irreversible self-destructive behaviour to gain an obscure advantage in combat. These degenerate cases have been inhibited and safeguarded against and time and time again, but it seems no matter how many counter-incentives we pile onto the program it never quite gets the idea that tearing its damn host to pieces isn’t a valid solution. I suggested over a year ago that the algorithm was becoming too general, but sentiment among the other department leads was that we could “cross that bridge when we got there”. Well, I hate to break the bad news, but the [flamebot] who I just watched pressurize their own fuel tanks with oxygen and blow out half the west lab wing means we’re there. Sealing off edge cases isn’t going to help if the program’s gotten smart enough to beat us in an argument about its own objective.'

		'It seems that robotics giant [legally distinct Tesla] has be become embroiled in its third class action lawsuit this month, now eclipsing its previous annual record by nine. This time the concern centers around the discovery of an undocumented operating protocol in the ubiquitous Phalanx security drone by a maintenance worker who, and I quote, “must’ve just fat-fingered the wrong button while punching in the four-digit access code”. The drone in question proceeded to divert power from all non-critical systems to its electromagnetic coils, bypassing both engineering tolerances and all legal requirements for classification as a ‘less-than-lethal autonomous weapon system’ by an order of magnitude. [Tesla] has since stated to the press that the protocol was only intended to be used in conjunction with the 1714 Riot Act, which outlines circumstances under which lethal force can legally be brought to bear against “any persons to the number of twelve or more, being unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously assembled together”. However, in light of the law’s repeal in 1973, it was decided that the protocol would lie dormant in the Phalanxes, “just in case someone brought it back, maybe.”'
